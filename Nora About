<style>
    /* Style looks pretty compact, 
       - grid-container and grid-item are referenced the code 
    */
    .grid-container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(150px, 1fr)); /* Dynamic columns */
        gap: 10px;
    }
    .grid-item {
        text-align: center;
    }
    .grid-item img {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100px; /* Fixed height for uniformity */
        object-fit: contain; /* Ensure the image fits within the fixed height */
    }
    .grid-item p {
        margin: 5px 0; /* Add some margin for spacing */
    }

    .image-gallery {
        display: flex;
        flex-wrap: nowrap;
        overflow-x: auto;
        gap: 10px;
        }

    .image-gallery img {
        max-height: 150px;
        object-fit: cover;
        border-radius: 5px;
    }
</style>

<!-- This grid_container class is used by CSS styling and the id is used by JavaScript connection -->
<div class="grid-container" id="grid_container">
    <!-- content will be added here by JavaScript -->
</div>

<script>
    // 1. Make a connection to the HTML container defined in the HTML div
    var container = document.getElementById("grid_container"); // This container connects to the HTML div

    // 2. Define a JavaScript object for our http source and our data rows for the Living in the World grid
    var http_source = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/";
    var living_in_the_world = [
        {"flag": "0/01/Flag_of_California.svg", "greeting": "Hey", "description": "California - A Few Months"},
       {"flag": "c/c3/Flag_of_New_Mexico.svg", "greeting": "Howdy", "description": "New Mexico - 11 years"},
    {"flag": "c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg", "greeting": "Eh?", "description": "Canada - 3 year"}
    ];

    // 3a. Consider how to update style count for size of container
    // The grid-template-columns has been defined as dynamic with auto-fill and minmax

    // 3b. Build grid items inside of our container for each row of data
    for (const location of living_in_the_world) {
        // Create a "div" with "class grid-item" for each row
        var gridItem = document.createElement("div");
        gridItem.className = "grid-item";  // This class name connects the gridItem to the CSS style elements
        // Add "img" HTML tag for the flag
        var img = document.createElement("img");
        img.src = http_source + location.flag; // concatenate the source and flag
        img.alt = location.flag + " Flag"; // add alt text for accessibility

        // Add "p" HTML tag for the description
        var description = document.createElement("p");
        description.textContent = location.description; // extract the description

        // Add "p" HTML tag for the greeting
        var greeting = document.createElement("p");

        gridItem.appendChild(greeting);

        // Append the grid item DIV to the container DIV
        container.appendChild(gridItem);

### Journey through Life<br>
<br>
Here is what I did at those places<br>

- üè´ In New Mexico, I went to Annuncation Catholic School from pre-school to 4th grade. Then moved to Canada for 3 years and then came back for the rest of 8th grade.<br>
- üè´ In Canada I went to St.David Middle School from 5th grade to half of 8th grade.<br>
- üè´ I moved to San Diego and started 9th grade. I graduate in 2028.<br>
<br>
### Culture, Family, and Fun<br>
<br>
Everything for me, as for many others, revolves around family and Friends.<br><br>

- I am Palestinian but I was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Most of my family all live back home in Bethlehem.<br>
- I have 5 people in my family. My parents, my two older sisters, and I am the youngest.<br>
- I also have an old shih tzu named Chewy, he is around 13 years old.<br>
